# Lagrangian-LES

This repository host the source codes for the manuscript "Lagrangian Large Eddy Simulations via Physics-Informed Machine Learning". The source codes were reviewed and approved with a LANL O-number O4653

The training of Lagrangian Large Eddy Simulation (L-LES) model can be divided into two parts, the smoothing kernel and the L-LES model as demonstrated by the two provided notebooks.

The dataset for turbulent Mach number (Mt) 0.08 is included in the dataset folder.
